Reduced refers here to a smaller problem size. Since the MVM algorithms is a matrix-based method, the input files may become very large. Thus, we assume here a smaller problem size to reduce the dimension of matrices involved. Note that the source files are working for a larger problem size as well. For a detailed step-by-step description we refer to the PDF document in the documentation directory of this repository.","metadata":{},"id":"7d6b6780-c3a3-4d10-9844-ede89f0c244f"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cd source","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"/home/jovyan/source\n","output_type":"stream"}],"id":"148f7963-e934-4424-8e3d-468b4294312d"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Create the ``Makefile`` and compile the code:","metadata":{},"id":"34008ab5-9500-4b1b-8a67-b27b8c4f9f71"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!cmake .\n!make all","metadata":{"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"-- The C compiler identification is GNU 7.5.0\n-- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 7.5.0\n-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc\n-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc -- works\n-- Detecting C compiler ABI info\n-- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done\n-- Detecting C compile features\n-- Detecting C compile features - done\n-- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++\n-- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++ -- works\n-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info\n-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done\n-- Detecting CXX compile features\n-- Detecting CXX compile features - done\n-- Configuring done\n-- Generating done\n-- Build files have been written to: /home/jovyan/source\n\u001b[35m\u001b[1mScanning dependencies of target benchmarks\u001b[0m\n[ 50%] \u001b[32mBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/benchmarks.dir/main.cpp.o\u001b[0m\n[100%] \u001b[32m\u001b[1mLinking CXX executable benchmarks\u001b[0m\n[100%] Built target benchmarks\n","output_type":"stream"}],"id":"0c7a9855-9a76-46aa-aeec-d24dd5a4cf85"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Run the benchmark test:","metadata":{},"id":"780c31f6-8e64-4552-90b8-4ebed0ac6a0c"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!./benchmarks","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"read input done!\nstart computation...\nreconstruct layers from sensor measurements...\n^C\n","output_type":"stream"}],"id":"79891cd9-c0cd-4b42-8129-5f18ac90af4b"}]}
